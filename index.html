            <p>Disc golf is similar to golf in that the goal is to finish a round in the 
                fewest amount of strokes. 
            </p>

            <p>Starting from the tee pad on each hole, the target is a basket in the distance 
                that you throw discs towards. You typically start with a driver, a mid range,
                and finish with a putter, although you can throw any disc for any throw.</p>

            <p>&apos;It's an extremely cheap sport to get into, as low as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000Q838XW/ref=asc_df_B000Q838XW5167161/?tag=hyprod-20&creative=394997&creativeASIN=B000Q838XW&linkCode=df0&hvadid=167128853713&hvpos=1o13&hvnetw=g&hvrand=7087500853336463737&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9022804&hvtargid=pla-315522356396">
                few dollars</a> for a couple of discs, 
                while the higher end of the sport is around $25/disc for the top of the line disc. &apos;</p>

            <ul>There are several different ways to throw the disc:
                    <li>Forehand</li>
                    <li>Backhand</li>
                    <li>Sidearm</li>
                    <li>Tomahawk</li></ul>
            

            <p>I'm pretty much great.</p>

            <p>That's about it for now.</p></center></div>
