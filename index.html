            <p>Disc golf is similar to golf in that the goal is to finish a round in the 
                fewest amount of strokes.

            <p>Starting from the tee pad on each hole, the target is a basket in the distance 
                that you throw discs towards. You typically start with a driver, a mid range,
                and finish with a putter, although you can throw any disc for any throw.
            </p>
            <p>&apos;It's an extremely cheap sport to get into, as low as a few dollare for a couple of discs, 
                while the higher end of the sport is around $25/disc for the top of the line disc. &apos;</p>

            <p>That's about it for now.</p></center></div>
